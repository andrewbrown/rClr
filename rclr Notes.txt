rclr Notes.txt

# Notes

* Installed RTools 3.5, selected all options for installation, and added it to %PATH% .
* Installed MiKTeX from: https://miktex.org/downloadinitexmf --edit-config-file updmap
* Diff repo to see changes made.
	* The diff to upgrade the .vcxproj was performed using Visual Studio 2017: 
		* rClr project would not open until rClr/src/rClr.props existed; was this created by some partially successful run of the R/Unix-based build process?
		* Open rClr.sln, right click on rClr, click Retarget Projects
* Nuget failed to install packages building from R/Unix-based build process on the command line.  Had to build rClr from VS first to get them installed		
* Also had to create build.bat above the rClr/ folder, and run it to build.
* Perform these steps to get the R package PDF to build successfully: https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/129523/165257

# References

* For getting the path to the proper version of MSBuild to use for the build, see this thread:

# Todo

* Replace all "ATBTODO" hacks with robust implementations
* Figure out how to set up src/rClr.vcxproj so that it uses appropriate versions 
WindowsTargetPlatformVersion makes it impossible to create generic project files: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/140294/windowstargetplatformversion-makes-it-impossible-t.html
Infer WindowsTargetPlatformVersion for MSVC: https://phabricator.kde.org/D10126
* Write up more detailed instructions for building, download and archive installers used.
* Figure out how to get Nuget working from the command line, so that first-time build attempt from inside VS isn't needed.
